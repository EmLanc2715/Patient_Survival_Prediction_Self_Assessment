### Self-Assessment

Over the course of this project I was in the triangle, or the machine learning model role. I created the machine learning model, ran our data through the model, tweaked the model to be more accurate, and analyzed the results. After this role was done, I worked on our google slide presentation. For the presentation I organzied the slides, wrote most of the text (apart from a majority of Brians Database slides, and also wrote the speaker notes. I also had a hand in the main branch README, after Tyler started it in week 1, I filled in the other requirements for Deliverables 2 and 3. Brian also added to the Database portion of the README in the main branch as well. The greatest personal challenge I had with this project was coming up with a clear direction for our data. Our whole group struggled in the beginning with narrowing down what trends we wanted to find with our data. We chose a very large dataset, initially it had over 90,000 row and hundreds of column. A dataset this large can make it difficult to find a focus, and this was the most difficult challenge that we ran in to.

### Team Assessment

I believe that our team worked extremely well together, and I am very proud of the final product that we delivered. We mainly communicated via Slack and Zoom throughout the process. I do not believe that we had any outstanding issues communicating as a team, everyone was very responive and participated equally. I think that our strength as a team lies with how collaborative we all were with each other through this process. As a team we discussed things openly, brainstormed together, and we all listened to the input from each other as well. I hope that in my future career I can collaborate with coworkers as well as I did with Brian and Tyler. 

### Summary of Project

Our team was interested in looking at patient data, specifically patients who were in the ICU. We selected hospital death as our main feature for our machine learning model, and we explored and cleaned up our data to make it usable for our final dataset for our Balanced Random Forest Classifier model. After trying out differing numbers of estimators, we chose to run our model with 5,000 estimators and we achieved an accuracy score of 79.3%. We were very happy with this result, but if we had more time, we would like to compare how our model performed against a neural network.
